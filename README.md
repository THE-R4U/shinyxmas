# Very shiny holidays

This is a R-shiny app based on a Codepen by [dodozhang21](https://codepen.io/dodozhang21/pen/imIvg) that builds a
Christmas tree with a slider for the size, number of balls on the tree. Behind the app there is snow falling,
such that the user will be able to select the speed of the snow.

You can run the app by simply using:

```
install.packages(c("dplyr","magrittr","stringr","shiny","shinyjs","glue"))
shiny::runApp()
```
